# PopMovies
Welcome to my PopularMovies1 Project! This project was to show off and demonstrate full understanding of Android fundamentals. The idea was simple: retrieve some data from TMDB's movie collection APIs, make it look pretty, and show relevant information. I originally started and completed this simple app about 2 years ago. Over time, as libraries and the SDK has changed, I have updated it to keep in touch with current standards. For example, instead of the original ListView, I now just have recyclerviews. I also have used ConstraintLayout, and I love it, good work Android team. TMDB's API has also changed somewhat, so I have accounted for that. In time, I will add other improvments.
